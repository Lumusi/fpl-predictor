# Mobile Performance Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve the mobile experience of the FPL Predictor app.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Player Card Component

- Added intersection observer to lazily render player cards only when they become visible in the viewport
- Reduced image size and quality for mobile devices (30px vs 60px on desktop)
- Further lowered image quality on mobile (40% vs 70% on desktop)
- Reduced animation and transition overhead for player cards

### 2. List Virtualization

- Enhanced React Window virtualization implementation 
- Added pagination-aware rendering to only process visible players
- Memoized list items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Reduced the overscan count on mobile (2 vs 5 on desktop) 
- Implemented page-based virtualization to limit the number of active components

### 3. Image Optimization

- Added device-aware image sizing and quality adjustments
- Implemented WebP format for better compression
- Added batch loading for images to prevent browser from loading too many at once
- Set `fetchPriority="low"` for non-critical images on mobile
- Added smaller image sizes for mobile responsive images

### 4. Mobile Device Detection

- Added network speed/quality detection
- Added device memory detection for low-end devices
- Added battery status monitoring for power-saving mode
- Added CSS optimizations for low-end devices

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- Added frame rate monitoring to detect when the app is running at lower than 25 FPS
- Added telemetry for mobile-specific metrics (battery, network, memory)
- Added CSS optimizations for low-performance modes:
  - Disabled animations
  - Removed box shadows and complex CSS features
  - Simplified gradients
  - Reduced motion for transitions

### 6. Mobile App Shell Enhancements

- Added data saving mode indicator
- Added viewport height fixing for mobile browsers
- Added detection for offline mode
- Added pull-to-refresh with visual feedback

## Technical Details

### Device-Aware Component Rendering

The application now adapts rendering based on device capabilities:

```tsx
// Example of device-aware component rendering
const imageSize = isMobile() ? 30 : 60;
const imageQuality = isMobile() ? 40 : 70;
```

### Virtualization Optimizations

```tsx
<FixedSizeList
  height={isMobile() ? 350 : 500}
  overscanCount={isMobile() ? 2 : 5}
  // Other props...
>
  {PlayerListRow} // Memoized row component
</FixedSizeList>
```

### Network Quality Detection

```typescript
// Network quality detection logic
if (navigator.connection) {
  const connectionTypes = ['slow-2g', '2g', 'cellular'];
  this.slowConnection = connectionTypes.includes(conn.effectiveType) || 
    (conn.downlink && conn.downlink < 1.0);
}
```

### Performance Mode CSS

```css
/* Performance optimizations for data saving mode */
.data-saving-mode .animate-pulse {
  animation: none !important;
}

/* Reduce shadow complexity */
.data-saving-mode * {
  box-shadow: none !important;
  text-shadow: none !important;
  backdrop-filter: none !important;
}
```

## Results

These optimizations have significantly improved the mobile experience:

- Reduced initial load time
- Smoother scrolling performance
- Less lag when adding/removing players
- Better performance on low-end devices and poor network conditions
- Reduced battery consumption
- More responsive UI for touch interactions

## Future Optimizations

- Consider server-side rendering of player lists
- Add caching layer for player images
- Implement background worker for data processing
- Consider splitting the application into smaller chunks
